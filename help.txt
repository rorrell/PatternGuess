The object of the game is to guess the pattern, which is made up of four colored pegs.  The possible colors are red, yellow, green, blue, black, and white, and no color will be repeated.  Make a guess by clicking on the pegs on the bottom of the screen.  When you have chosen four, smaller pegs will be displayed to the left of your guess to give you hints about how close you are to the answer.  Of these, a white peg indicates a correct color in the wrong position, whereas a black peg indicates a correct color in the right position.  Make each guess based on the feedback from all of your previous guesses.  The correct answer will be shown when you have either: 1) made the correct guess; 2) made the maximum number of incorrect guesses (filled the board); or 3) chosen "Show Solution" from the "File" menu.  Choose "New" from the "File" menu to start a new game.
